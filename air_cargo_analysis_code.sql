/*  1.	Create an ER diagram for the given airlines database.

Steps to create the ER diagram for the given airlines database:

Open MySQL Workbench:
	Launch MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
	Create a new EER Diagram:
	Go to File > New Model.
	In the new model window, go to Model > Add Diagram.

Create Tables:
	In the EER Diagram window, use the table tool (found in the toolbar) to create new tables.
	Double-click each table to open the table editor and define the columns (attributes), setting primary keys and foreign keys as needed.

Define the Tables:
Customer Table:
	customer_id (PK)
	first_name
	last_name
	date_of_birth
	gender

Passengers_on_flights Table:
	aircraft_id
	route_id
	customer_id (FK)
	depart
	arrival
	seat_num
	class_id
	travel_date
	flight_num

Ticket_details Table:
	p_date
	customer_id (FK)
	aircraft_id
	class_id
	no_of_tickets
	a_code
	price_per_ticket
	brand

Routes Table:
	route_id (PK)
	flight_num
	origin_airport
	destination_airport
	aircraft_id
	distance_miles

Set Primary and Foreign Keys:
Customer Table: 
	Set customer_id as the Primary Key.
Passengers_on_flights Table:
	Set customer_id as a Foreign Key that references Customer.customer_id.
Ticket_details Table:
	Set customer_id as a Foreign Key that references Customer.customer_id.
Routes Table:
	Set route_id as the Primary Key.

Create Relationships:
Customer - Passengers_on_flights:
	Create a one-to-many relationship between Customer.customer_id and Passengers_on_flights.customer_id.
Customer - Ticket_details:
	Create a one-to-many relationship between Customer.customer_id and Ticket_details.customer_id.
Passengers_on_flights - Routes:
	Create a one-to-many relationship between Routes.route_id and Passengers_on_flights.route_id.
Routes - Ticket_details:
	This relationship is indirect through the aircraft and flight number, but for simplicity, you can create an indirect relationship through aircraft_id.

Steps in MySQL Workbench:
Adding Tables:
	Click on the Add Table button (table icon) and place the table on the diagram.
	Double-click the table to open the editor and add columns.
	Define the data types for each column (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE).

Defining Primary Keys:
	In the table editor, select the column and check the PK checkbox to set it as the primary key.

Defining Foreign Keys:
	In the table editor, go to the Foreign Keys tab.
	Add a new foreign key, specify the column, and set the referenced table and column.

Creating Relationships:
	Use the Place a Relationship tools (one-to-many and many-to-many) to draw lines between related tables.
	Click on a primary key in one table and drag to the foreign key in another table to create the relationship.
